_The Benefits of Cooperation in a Highly Renewable European Electricity Network_  
[_doi:10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.004_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.004)

The files in this record contain the model-specific code, input data, and output data considered in the Benefits of Cooperation paper.

You are welcome to use the provided data under the given open-source licence, and if you do please cite the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.06.004).  
Please note that the derivation of the data in `data/renewables/` is not open, because it uses the `REatlas` software [7] which has a closed source server part. (There is an free software implementation of the `REatlas` at https://github.com/FRESNA/atlite but it wasn't ready in time to be used for this dataset.)

The code that is required to generate the output data consists of

  - the python code `opt_ws_network.py` that builds and runs the [PyPSA](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.582307) [0] model
  - a SLURM script `parameter_batch.py` to run the model with different parameters
  - a YAML file `options.yml` with the default parameter settings

The code heavily relies on the python package _vresutils_ which is available at https://github.com/FRESNA/vresutils

The record also contains the input data in the `data/` directory. They are described in detail in the paper, but a short summary is provided here:
  - **costs**: cost and other input parameter assumptions, see _Table 1_ in the paper.
  - **graph**: the network topology is given by a list of nodes (country names) and a list of edges connecting two nodes. Based on [1,2].
  - **hydro**: hydro generation data provided by the Restore2050 project [3]
    * `inflow/`: contains a csv files with daily inflow data for each country
    * `emil_hydro_capas.csv`: country-scale power and energy capacity
    * `ror_ENTSOe_Restore2050.csv`: the share of run-of-river of the total hydro generation, from ENTSO-E [4] or if unavailable from [3]
  - **load**: hourly country-scale consumption for 2011 from ENTSO-E [5]
  - **renewables**: generation potentials for the renewable technologies onshore wind, offshore wind, and solar per country based on historic weather data [6]. The jupyter-notebook `europe_renewables_potentials.ipynb` describes the data generation and uses the `REatlas` software [7] which has open-source client but closed-source server software. The used `cutout` can therefore not be made available here, but is solely based on data from [8]. The processed data are in:
    * `store_p_nom_max/`: installation potential per technology per region
    * `store_o_max_pu_betas/`: hourly maximum generation per unit of capacity per technology per region

The output data generated by the model is in sub-folders of the `results/` directory following the naming scheme `[costsource]-CO[CO2costs]-T[timerange]-[technologies]-LV[linevolume]_c[crossover]_base_[costsource]_solar1_7_[formulation]-[startdate]/`, where

  * costsource   = diw2030
  * CO2costs     = 0
  * timerange    = 1_8761
  * technologies = wWsgrpHb
  * linevolume   = [float], None (line volume constraint of `float` * 5e8 TWkm, or optimised line volume)
  * crossover    = 0 (deactivated the cross-over phase of the Gurobi optimiser)
  * formulation  = angles, [blank] (power flow formulations: 'angles', or 'cycles')
  * startdate    = time the optimisation was started
